# First-Web-Map
## Introduction
### This map was made for a web mapping class. This is the first official web map I have created and published. It is a map of the Greenway Trail in Boone, NC. It highlights my favorite walking trail and several stops and scenic parts of the trail.  
## Major functions
### The map has six points of interest that are marked and, when clicked on, will describe each location. There is a map description as well as a link to the Explore Boone website page about the Boone Greenway Trail.
## Libraries
### Leaflet.js (for map creation and customization)
### jQuery (for handling DOM manipulation and event handling)
### Leaflet.css, and Google Fonts (stylesheets for the design of the user interface)
## Data sources of the Map
### Google Maps
### Website for Boone Greenway
